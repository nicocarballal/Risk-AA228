## Project Overview
We are planning on tackling the game of RISK â€“ the popular game whose name conveniently alludes to the topic of uncertainty. At a high level, we aim to solve the problem of the ideal strategy to conquer the world in the game of RISK. We aim to investigate novel strategies to deal with the copious amount of possible state spaces in the game.
